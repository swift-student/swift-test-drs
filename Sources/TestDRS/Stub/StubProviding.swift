/// `StubProviding` is a protocol that defines a stubbing mechanism for unit testing.
/// It allows you to replace real method calls with stubbed responses, making it easier to test your code in isolation.
/// Each stub is associated with the function's signature, input type, and output type.
/// This information is used to retrieve the stub when the function is called.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```
/// class MyClass: StubProviding {
///     let stubRegistry = StubRegistry()
///
///     func foo() -> Int {
///         stubOutput()
///     }
/// }
///
/// let myClass = MyClass()
/// myClass.setStub(for: myClass.foo, withSignature: "foo()", returning: 42)
/// print(myClass.foo())  // Prints "42"
/// ```
